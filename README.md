# Text to Morse Code Converter

## Description

This is a simple Python program that converts text input into Morse code. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. The program takes user input in the form of text and outputs the corresponding Morse code representation.

## Features

- Converts text input into Morse code.
- Supports alphanumeric characters and common punctuation marks.
- Outputs the Morse code representation with spaces between characters and slashes (/) between words.
- Minimalist command-line interface for input and output.
